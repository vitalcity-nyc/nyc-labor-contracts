"""Export companion reference documents for the NotebookLM notebook.

The notebook's primary sources are the 99 contract text files
(export_text_only.py). These companion files add the context the contract
text alone cannot answer — which contracts exist and when they expire, what
the union acronyms mean, who each bargaining unit covers and the verified
wage patterns. Every file is headed with a provenance note so NotebookLM
citations clearly distinguish companion reference material from contract
text.

Only human-verified data is exported: curated unit entries (with sourced
headcounts) and curated wage schedules (with verification level and source
note). Unverified auto-extracted percentages are deliberately excluded.

{BANNER}
This notebook contains the full text of {manifest['contracts']} collective bargaining agreements covering New York City municipal employees: every agreement published on the New York City Office of Labor Relations "Recent Agreements" page, plus major NYC public-sector contracts that bargain outside that office (Uniformed Firefighters Association, Uniformed Fire Officers Association, New York State Nurses Association at NYC Health + Hospitals and the Professional Staff Congress at the City University of New York).

## How the text was produced

Many of the source documents are scanned image PDFs with no embedded text. Each page was extracted with a text-layer reader where possible and with optical character recognition (macOS Vision, with Google Cloud Vision for the seven worst-quality documents) where not. Roughly 1,000 high-confidence OCR misreads have been hand-reviewed and corrected, and two agreements — the Committee of Interns and Residents contract and the PSC-CUNY 2023-2027 memorandum of agreement — are drawn from text-native copies published by the unions themselves, which eliminates OCR error in those documents entirely.

## Cautions for answering questions

- OCR text can still contain transcription mistakes, especially in signature blocks, addresses and dense wage tables. When a number matters, recommend verifying against the source PDF (each contract file links to it).
- Contract terms in these documents are frequently retroactive: an agreement signed in 2024 may have a term that began in 2021.
- Several uniformed unit agreements are short letters that incorporate the Uniformed Coalition Economic Agreement by reference — economic terms for those units live in that coalition document, not the unit letter.
- The corpus reflects agreements published as of June 2026. The latest bargaining round may not be posted yet for some unions.
