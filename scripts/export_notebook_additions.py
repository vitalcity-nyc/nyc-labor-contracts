"""Generate ADDITIVE companion docs for the Gemini Notebook.

The notebook already holds the 100 contract texts and companion docs 00-04.
Those contract texts are unchanged and correct. Rather than ask for a full
re-upload, this writes three new files that complement what is already there:

  companion-05  document types — which documents are complete contracts and
                which are amendments, and what subjects each type actually
                covers. The notebook currently cannot answer "is this the whole
                contract?" for any document.
  companion-06  underlying agreements — verified links to the prior agreements
                that the amendments modify, which live on separate pages the
                amendments never reference.
  companion-07  corrections — supersedes specific facts in the already-uploaded
                companion docs, so stale figures in those files do not produce
                wrong answers. Additive by design: no re-upload required.

Output: data/notebook-additions/ plus a zip alongside it.
