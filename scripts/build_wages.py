"""Build data/wages.json — general wage increase (GWI) schedules per contract.

Every CURATED entry below has been verified directly against the OCR'd
contract text. Percentages, effective dates, and bonus amounts are quoted
from the source agreement. The `verified` field records what level of
verification each entry has reached:

  "full"      — both percentages AND effective dates were located in the
                contract text and quoted exactly.
  "partial"   — percentages verified; some dates inferred from the
                contract's Successor-Unit-Agreement reference structure.
  "pattern"   — the unit's GWI is set by reference to a parent agreement
                (e.g., the Uniformed Coalition Economic Agreement). The
                percentages applied are taken from that parent agreement.
  "appendix"  — GWI lives in a wage-table Appendix that didn't extract
                cleanly from the source PDF; we link to the PDF rather
                than guess. Entry shows the term and bonus only.
